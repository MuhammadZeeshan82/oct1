Project Objective: To create an automated deployment pipeline using Jenkins, Terraform, and Git to deploy an EC2 instance on AWS. This project aims to improve the efficiency and consistency of deploying infrastructure by automating the process and reducing the risk of human error. The pipeline should pull the Terraform configuration files from the Git repository, apply the configuration using Terraform, and deploy the EC2 instance on AWS. The final outcome is to have a fully functional and accessible EC2 instance for further use in development, testing, or production environments.
What is Jenkins at a high level? Jenkins is an open-source automation server that provides a way to automate parts of the software development process, including building, testing, and deploying software applications. It is a continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) tool that automates the software delivery process by allowing developers to build, test, and deploy code changes in a consistent and repeatable way. Jenkins enables teams to quickly detect and fix errors, streamline the development process, and ultimately deliver higher-quality software faster. It offers an extensive plugin ecosystem that supports integrations with a wide range of tools and technologies, making it a versatile and flexible tool for teams of all sizes and industries.
